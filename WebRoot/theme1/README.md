# Swagger UI responsive theme

With inspiration from the [Auth0 api explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/apiv2) the original Swagger UI repo is modified to use a responsive layout.

The theme will adapt to screen size and works on tablets and mobile phones.

A JSON editor for the request body (disabled by default).

JSON editor configuration example:

```javascript
                jsonEditor: true,
                jsonEditorOptions: {
                    disableProperties:false,
                    disableEditJson:false,
                    removeEmptyProperties:true,
                    noDefaultProperties:true
                },
                docExpansion: "none",
                sorter: "alpha",
```

Give it a [try](http://swaggerui.herokuapp.com/?url=http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json) and enter your own swagger definition.
